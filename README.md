# Dark Matter Enhanced ✨

This is like a **glow-up** ✨ for the "Dark Matter" BetterDiscord theme! It keeps the cool dark vibes but makes it even **sleeker** and **more modern**.

## What's New? 💅

* **Bye-bye Background Image! 👋** We ditched the busy background image for a clean, solid dark look.
* **Gorgeous Colors! 🎨**  We picked some really nice teals and dark grays to make everything look super stylish.
* **Fonts with Personality! ✍️** You'll notice the text looks extra sharp now, thanks to some carefully chosen fonts.
* **Rounded Edges for Days! ⚪** Everything just looks smoother and more modern with rounded corners everywhere.
